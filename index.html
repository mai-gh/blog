Project Overhaul


I originally designed this blog to retrieve posts via github api / raw links and
use client side javascript to "fetch" and render them. I changed my mind on this
approach in favor of commit time injection to create a static site. Ultimately
this guarantees clients will not have bugs, and the site will load faster, and
that github api cant gatekeep me. This is accomplished using nodeJS and the
jsdom library. jsdom makes it easy to manipulate a html file just like you would
with front-end code, then just save the rusulting html code as a static site.

planned features coming soon:

 - very minimal markup syntax for links and images and possibly videos
 - stylized subject and dates
 - a footer ;-P
 - pagination

I want to keep this "framework" as minimal and tight as possible, so probably
not much more will be considered, unless it really makes my life easier at
little to no cost.

Cheers!

About this place

On this blog I will be journaling my developer experience, both professionally,
and personally. I will be using this space to write about interests, ideas,
rants, got-yas, hardware &amp; software, and possibly some non techy stuff too.

Stay tuned!
