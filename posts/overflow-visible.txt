Have you ever been to a site that tries to prevent you from viewing content by
disabling your ability to scroll? Its not hard to block elements and faded
backgrounds with <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">ublock-origin</a>.

But you still end up unable to scroll?

Here is a cheap hack, if you use a bookmarks toolbar, you can add a bookmark to
run a javascript snippet just as if you were to open the developers console and
run it in there.

And now I present the universal scroll button. Create a new favorite and put it
on your bookmarks toolbar, name it scroll. Now for the location: put the
following

<pre class='pre-code'>javascript: (() => { Array.from(document.all).forEach(e => {e.style.setProperty('overflow', 'visible', 'important')}); })();</pre>

This will change the override the css rules that prevent scrolling. YMMV and
there could also be other css rules that prevent scrolling, or event listeners
that can interfere as well. When I come across these I will update this post.

Happy Scrolling!
