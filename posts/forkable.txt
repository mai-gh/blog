<h2>This project is now forkable!</h2>



I have now moved all the non-personal parts of this framework to now be forkable

Introducing li-ili-i

<a href=https://github.com/mai-gh/li-ili-i>https://github.com/mai-gh/li-ili-i</a>

The name liʻiliʻi comes from me searching for other words for minimal.

liʻiliʻi is Hawaiian for tiny.


Anyway feel free to fork and start you own micro blog with this, and if you find
a change that makes this even simpler, feel free to submit a pull request.

Cheers!
