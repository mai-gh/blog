OpenWRT creates dynamic domain names for its local area network with the domain
extension <pre>.lan</pre>

when you try to go to one of these in firefox, it thinks you are trying to do a
search... unless you manually type out the protocol eg <pre>http://neighbor.lan</pre>

the fix is easy, but unfortunately also easy to forget (which is why I'm writing
this!)

got to about:config

search for <pre>browser.fixup.domainsuffixwhitelist.lan</pre>

it wont exist, add it as boolean type with value true

that's it!
